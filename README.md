# PyGrad

> Python port of Degrad: http://degrad.web.cern.ch/degrad/
> Calculates degradation spectra for particle interactions in gaseous mixtures of up to 6 gases.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- gfortran
- make

## Setup
	python3 -m pip install --upgrade  git+https://github.com/UTA-REST/PyBoltz.git --user

The shell script `config.sh` sets all the necessary environment variables, so it is necessary to run `source config.sh` upon opening a new terminal window.

## Features

- Loads in cross section data for gas mixture
- Calculates fluorescent absorption distance
- does preliminary Monte Carlo calculations

## Usage

- The library can be used by importing the pygrad module, setting the parameters, and running.  The script PygradRun.py provides an example of this.

 
## Documentation

- Documentation is generated by Doxygen and can be found in the `docs` folder.

## Tests

- Tests are created using the unittest module and can be run on their own by python
- To run all tests:
`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`
You can also go into the `tests` directory and run any of the test files individually.
